checklist of concurrency concepts you can try today:

Level	Topics	Tools
🟢 Basic	Creating threads, Runnable, Thread class	Thread, Runnable
🟡 Intermediate	Thread-safe data structures, synchronization	synchronized, volatile, ConcurrentHashMap
🟠 Advanced	Thread pools, tasks, futures, scheduling	ExecutorService, Callable, Future, ScheduledExecutorService
🔴 Real-world	Producer-Consumer, blocking queue, deadlock handling	BlockingQueue, Semaphore, CountDownLatch

Parallel File Processor

Task Scheduler

API Request Flooder Simulator


can try:
Producer-Consumer using BlockingQueue

Deadlock demo and fix

CountDownLatch / CyclicBarrier demo

AtomicInteger usage

Parallel Stream performance test vs manual threads

A thread-safe ID generator?

A producer-consumer simulation?

A task scheduler using ScheduledExecutorService




✅ Level 1: Core Threading (You're already 90% done)
✅ Thread lifecycle (new, runnable, running, waiting, terminated)

✅ Difference between start() and run()

✅ Runnable vs Callable

✅ synchronized methods/blocks

✅ Race conditions and data sharing

✅ AtomicInteger and CAS

✅ Using ExecutorService with submit, shutdown, awaitTermination

✔️ You can revise once, but you're already confident here.

⚙️ Level 2: Advanced Executors
🔲 FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, SingleThreadExecutor

🔲 ScheduledExecutorService (like cron jobs)

🔲 invokeAll() and invokeAny() – run multiple tasks in parallel

🔲 ThreadFactory – customize thread creation

🔲 RejectedExecutionHandler – handle task overflow when pool is full

🧠 Practice: Write a task scheduler that runs every 10 seconds and logs something.

🔒 Level 3: Thread Safety Techniques
🔲 volatile keyword — memory visibility guarantee (not locking!)

🔲 ReentrantLock vs synchronized – flexible locking

🔲 ReadWriteLock – allow multiple readers

🔲 ThreadLocal – data isolation per thread

🧠 Practice: Create a multi-user session manager using ThreadLocal.

🤝 Level 4: Inter-Thread Communication
🔲 wait() / notify() / notifyAll() – low-level coordination

🔲 BlockingQueue – thread-safe producer-consumer

🔲 CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier – thread coordination

🔲 Semaphore, Exchanger, Phaser – control access & synchronization

🧠 Practice: Implement a producer-consumer queue using BlockingQueue.

💡 Level 5: Modern Concurrency
🔲 CompletableFuture – async, non-blocking pipelines

🔲 ForkJoinPool – parallel task splitting for big jobs

🔲 Parallel Streams – .parallelStream()

🔲 Virtual Threads (Project Loom) – preview feature in Java 21+

🔲 Structured concurrency (newer style of managing task groups)

🧠 Practice: Create a file searcher using CompletableFuture that searches across directories concurrently.

🔧 Level 6: Debugging + Real Projects
🔲 Thread dumps and deadlock detection

🔲 Simulating real-world issues (e.g., data corruption, out-of-order writes)

🔲 Building thread-safe components: cache, queue, counter, etc.

🔲 Logging thread activity using thread names & timestamps

🧠 Project: Build a real-time log aggregator using threads and queues.
