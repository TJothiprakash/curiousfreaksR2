✅ 7-Day System Design Interview Plan (with Best YouTube Links)
Each day includes:

🔍 What to learn

🎥 Top 2–3 YouTube resources

✍️ What to sketch/practice

💡 Real-world app examples

📅 Day 1 – Load Balancing + Caching (Core of Scaling)
🔍 Topics:
What is a Load Balancer?

Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

What is Caching? TTL, Invalidation

Redis/Memcached basics

🎥 Videos:
Gaurav Sen – Load Balancers

Tech Dummies – Redis Caching

✍️ Sketch:
Client → LB → Multiple App Servers

Add Redis between App & DB

💡 Example:
Design a login API that handles 10K RPS

📅 Day 2 – Database Scaling + Replication + Sharding
🔍 Topics:
SQL vs NoSQL

Read replicas, master-slave

Partitioning & Sharding

🎥 Videos:
Gaurav Sen – Scaling Databases

System Design Simplified – Replication vs Sharding

✍️ Sketch:
DB with replicas + write routing

💡 Example:
Design a Blog platform with 1M readers

📅 Day 3 – Message Queues + Rate Limiting
🔍 Topics:
When to use Kafka/RabbitMQ

Async processing (email, payments)

Rate limiting: fixed window, token bucket

🎥 Videos:
Kafka Simplified in 15 mins

Rate Limiting – Tech Dummies

✍️ Sketch:
Client → App → Queue → Worker

Redis-based rate limiter

💡 Example:
Forgot password email queue

API throttling: 5 req/min

📅 Day 4 – CDN + CAP Theorem + Availability Zones
🔍 Topics:
CDN: Cloudflare, Akamai

CAP: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance

Fault tolerance zones

🎥 Videos:
CAP Theorem in 5 mins – CodeKarle

How CDN Works – ByteByteGo

✍️ Sketch:
Static assets via CDN + fallback logic

💡 Example:
Serve frontend React app via CDN (Render, Vercel)

📅 Day 5 – API Gateway + OAuth + Auth Basics
🔍 Topics:
API Gateway for microservices

OAuth2.0 flow, JWT, sessions

AuthN vs AuthZ

🎥 Videos:
OAuth Simplified – Husseiin Nasir

API Gateway Concept – ByteByteGo

✍️ Sketch:
Gateway → Auth → User/Order/Email services

💡 Example:
Tools app backend using role-based access (User/Admin)

📅 Day 6 – Real System Design Problems
🔍 Practice:
Design URL Shortener

Design Pastebin

Design Rate Limiter

🎥 Videos:
Design URL Shortener – Gaurav Sen

Design Pastebin – Tech Dummies

✍️ Sketch:
DB schema, caching, traffic scaling

💡 Bonus:
Try explaining your own Tools App
e.g., "We cache reset-token in Redis with TTL, backend on Render, DB on Singlestore."

📅 Day 7 – Mock + Whiteboard + Storytelling
🎯 Focus:
Re-explain 2 designs from scratch

Practice “tradeoff talk”:
“I chose Redis for speed, but we risk stale data.”

💬 Practice:
Tell your Tools App architecture
Start from user signup → auth → email → password reset → Redis

🧾 Tips to Succeed
Tip	Why It Helps
📓 Keep 1 notebook	Reuse sketches for interviews
⏱️ Use 1-hour blocks	Don’t over-consume videos
🗣️ Explain to yourself out loud	Forces clarity
🧩 Think in components	Clients → LB → App → Cache → DB
