 - learn array deque for optimizing the sliding window quesitons
 - learn each type of question well and understand



✅ Final Summary You Just Said (Perfectly):
Aspect	Explanation
Each element	Added once, removed once from deque
Total Time	O(n) — because all operations (push/pop) happen max once per element
Per Window Space	O(k) — the deque holds at most k indices (one full window)
Why O(k) space?	Because at any time, the deque tracks only the elements of the current window
