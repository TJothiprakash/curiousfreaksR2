           Subset (Parent)

  Combination          Subsequence
✅ Why Subset is the Parent:
Concept	Fixed Size?	Order Matters?	Example Use
Subset	❌ (0 to n)	❌	Power Set generation, feature toggles
Combination	✅ (size r)	❌	Team formation, lottery picks
Subsequence	❌	✅ (original order preserved)	String problems like LCS

🔁 Intuition:
Subset = all combinations of all sizes (0 to n), order doesn't matter.

Combination = a filtered case of subset: only one fixed size.

Subsequence = order matters, may or may not be contiguous.

🔍 Real Example:
Set = {a, b, c}
→ Subsets = ["", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"] → 2³ = 8 subsets
→ Combinations of size 2 = ["ab", "ac", "bc"] → C(3, 2) = 3
→ Subsequences = all ways to skip elements without reordering → ["", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"] → same as subsets in small cases

 Quick Intuition:
Subsequence = Follow the order, skip some if needed.

Subset = Just choose any combination of elements, order doesn't matter.

Combination = A subset where size is fixed.
