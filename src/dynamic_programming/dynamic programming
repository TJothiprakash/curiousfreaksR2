‚úÖ Use Memoization When:
You're computing a single value (e.g., maxPathSum, count of all paths, minCost, etc.).

You can reuse subproblem results (like dp[i][j] = number of ways to reach (i,j)).

You want optimal time complexity, trading it with some additional space.

You're not storing full paths, but rather an aggregate result.

Example: Counting unique paths avoiding obstacles
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
‚Üí O(nm) time, O(nm) space

‚ùó Use Backtracking When:
You're generating all possible paths/combinations (like returning List<List<Something>>).

The result is non-trivial and large (like storing full paths, strings, permutations, etc.).

You want to avoid memory explosion from caching large complex structures.

You want fine control over recursion tree traversal (e.g., pruning, constraint-based search).

Example: Generating all paths from (0,0) to (n-1,m-1) avoiding obstacles
‚Üí Backtracking with path list and backtracking logic
‚Üí O(2^(n+m)) time in worst-case, O(n+m) auxiliary space (for recursion/path)

ü§ù Hybrid Pattern?
You can sometimes combine both:

Use backtracking but memoize results only when needed (like partial path count from (i,j) onward).

Use backtracking with pruning to avoid useless paths early (e.g., blocked by obstacle, or invalid path).

üî• Your Catch:
‚ÄúIf still I want to go with the memorization the space would be so much high because creating a list of list with n*m size that would be huge.‚Äù

‚úÖ Correct. If you're storing all List<List<Integer>> of paths at every (i,j), then:

Memory usage is exponential.

Cache size grows massive (O(2^(n+m)) * (avg path length)).

‚úÖ Summary
Goal	Preferred Approach
Return single result (count, sum)	Memoization
Return all valid results (paths)	Backtracking
Optimize overlapping calls	Memo + Backtrack
Tight memory constraints	Backtrack + Prune
