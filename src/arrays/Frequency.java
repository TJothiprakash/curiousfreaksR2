/*You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. These integers can be from 1 to p, and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers that lie in the range 1 to n.

Note:

Do modify the array in-place changes in arr[], such that arr[i] = frequency(i) and assume 1-based indexing.
The elements greater than n in the array can be ignored when counting.
Examples

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [2, 3, 2, 3, 5], p = 5
Output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 2 times. 3 occurring 2 times. 4 occurring 0 times. 5 occurring 1 time, all the modifications done in the same given arr[].
Input: n = 4, arr[] = [3, 3, 3, 3], p = 3
Output: [0, 0, 4, 0]
Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 0 times. 3 occurring 4 times. 4 occurring 0 times.
Input: n = 2, arr[] = [8, 9], p = 9
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 0 times. Since here P=9, but there are no 9th Index present so can't count the value.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ p ≤ 4*104
1 <= arr[i] <= p
