| Matrix is row & column sorted  | You can treat it like multiple sorted lists      |
| Use Min-Heap                   | To always get the next smallest element          |
| Push First Element of Each Row | Because they are the heads of each sorted stream |
| After Polling                  | Push the next element **from the same row** only |
| Heap ensures global order      | So you never need to manually compare rows       |
| Duplicates are fine            | Heap handles them â€” just values matter           |
