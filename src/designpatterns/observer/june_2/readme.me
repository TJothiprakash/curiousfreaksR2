Pros & Cons
‚úÖ Pros
Loose coupling

Scalable (can add/remove observers dynamically)

Great for real-time updates

‚ùå Cons
Can become complex with many observers

Difficult to debug

Risk of memory leaks if observers aren‚Äôt unsubscribed (especially in GUIs)

üß† 7. Best Practices
Keep the Observer interface minimal (void update() or void notify(data)).

Allow dynamic registration/unregistration.

Handle exceptions in observer notification ‚Äî don't let one bad observer crash the loop.

If you're in multithreaded environments ‚Üí use CopyOnWriteArrayList or proper synchronization.

Use lambdas / consumers in Java 8+ for cleaner observer definitions.

üõ†Ô∏è 8. Where to extend next?
You can now explore:

Generic Observer pattern (Observer<T>)

Event-based systems (publishers send only to interested types)

Reactive programming (RxJava, Project Reactor ‚Äî next-level Observer)

Java‚Äôs legacy Observable / Observer classes (not recommended but useful to study)
