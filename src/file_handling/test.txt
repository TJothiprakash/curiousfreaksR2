✅ File Handling with Streams – Pro Developer Checklist
📁 I. Basic File Operations
✅ Read all lines from a file into a List<String>

✅ Read large file using BufferedReader with lines() stream

✅ Count the number of lines in a file

✅ Count the number of non-empty lines

✅ Count total words in a file

✅ Read file and join all lines into a single String

✅ Write stream data to a file (Files.write)

📂 II. Directory Operations
✅ List all files in a folder

✅ List only .txt, .csv, etc. files using a filter

✅ Recursively list all files in subdirectories using Files.walk

✅ Count total files in a directory

✅ Find the largest/smallest file by size

🔐 III. Data Transformations
✅ Convert each line of a file into SHA-256 hash

✅ Convert each line to JSON format

✅ Convert CSV to List of custom Java objects

✅ Convert list of file lines to a Map<String, Integer> (e.g., word count)

✅ Replace specific words or patterns in lines (like masking email/passwords)

🔎 IV. Search & Filter
✅ Find lines containing a specific word (e.g., "ERROR")

✅ Count how many times a word appears in a file

✅ Find duplicate lines in a file

✅ Find top N most frequent words

✅ Get lines that match a regex pattern (e.g., emails, URLs)

🔄 V. Merging & Multi-file Operations
✅ Merge contents of multiple files into one file

✅ Combine multiple file contents into one String or JSON object

✅ Create a Map<filename, lineCount> for all files in a directory

✅ Group files by extension and list them

📊 VI. Statistics & Histograms
✅ Build a line-length histogram

✅ Build a frequency histogram of words or characters

✅ Get min, max, average line length

✅ Get total character count, line count, and word count

🧪 VII. Advanced Ideas (Optional Bonus)
⏳ Process logs and filter based on timestamp

⚡ Use parallelStream() for large directory processing

🔄 Watch a directory for file changes and react (Java NIO WatchService + Streams)

🧵 Stream a file line-by-line while writing modified output to another file
