/*Exercise 5: Thread priorities on different OS platforms

How it behaves:

Windows:

JVM maps Java thread priorities (1â€“10) to Windows thread priorities.

Higher-priority threads get more CPU time, low-priority threads can be starved in extreme cases.

Linux / UNIX:

Linux uses time-slicing with nice values.

Java priorities are hints, not guarantees.

The OS scheduler may largely ignore small priority differences unless using real-time scheduling.

macOS:

Similar to Linux; thread priority hints are not strictly enforced.

Conclusion:

Thread priorities are hints to the scheduler, not guarantees.

Behavior varies by OS and JVM implementation.

For critical tasks, do not rely on priority for correctness; use proper synchronization and task management instead.*/
