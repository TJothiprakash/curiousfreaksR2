🔁 What git rebase main does on branch-a
🧠 Rebase = "Replay my commits on top of the latest main"
🔍 Case-by-Case Breakdown:
✅ Case 1: main is ahead of branch-a (new commits on main)
main: A → B → C

branch-a: A → X → Y

When you run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout branch-a
git rebase main
✅ Git does:

css
Copy
Edit
1. Temporarily remove commits X and Y
2. Fast-forward to C (main)
3. Replay X and Y on top of C
   📦 Result:

css
Copy
Edit
main: A → B → C
branch-a: A → B → C → X' → Y'  ← (rewritten X, Y)
✅ Case 2: main is behind branch-a (no new commits on main)
main: A

branch-a: A → X → Y

You rebase onto main:

bash
Copy
Edit
git rebase main
🟢 Since main is behind, Git simply rewrites your commits (optional unless needed):

css
Copy
Edit
branch-a: A → X' → Y'
👉 Files likely remain unchanged, only commit hashes change (due to rebase).

✅ Case 3: main and branch-a both have new commits (diverged)
main: A → B → C

branch-a: A → X → Y

Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
git rebase main
📦 Git:

Temporarily removes X, Y

Applies B → C from main

Re-applies X → Y on top of C

Result:

css
Copy
Edit
main: A → B → C
branch-a: A → B → C → X' → Y'
❗ Conflicts can happen if B or C and X or Y modify the same files.

❓ So when does rebase just keep branch-a unchanged?
Only if it's already based on the latest main (i.e., main and branch-a have same commit history)

Otherwise, some form of history rewrite happens, even if no file conflict

✅ TL;DR:
main status	What happens during rebase main from branch-a
Ahead	Rebase applies your commits on top of main's new commits
Behind	No change except commit hashes rewritten
Diverged	Rebase replays your commits after syncing with main (conflicts possible)
Same	No effect (already up to date)

Let me know if you want to try this in a dummy repo setup. I can walk you through each command with examples.
