/*
Problem:
Koko loves to eat bananas. She has `n` piles of bananas, where the `i-th` pile has `v[i]` bananas.
Each hour, she chooses a pile and eats up to `k` bananas. If the pile has less than `k`, she eats all.

Given `h` hours to eat all bananas, find the **minimum integer speed `k`** such that she can finish all the bananas within `h` hours.

Intuition:
- The smaller the eating speed `k`, the more time Koko takes.
- We can binary search on `k` in the range [1, max(v[i])]
- For each `k`, we calculate the total hours needed. If it's within `h`, we try a smaller `k`.

Dry Run:
v = [7, 15, 6, 3], h = 8
max pile = 15, so search in [1, 15]
Try k = 8 ‚Üí hours = ceil(7/8) + ceil(15/8) + ceil(6/8) + ceil(3/8) = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 ‚â§ 8 ‚Üí try smaller
Try k = 4 ‚Üí 2+4+2+1 = 9 > 8 ‚Üí try bigger
