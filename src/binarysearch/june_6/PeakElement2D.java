/*
Problem:
You are given an m x n integer matrix `mat` where each row is sorted and each column is unsorted.
Your task is to find a peak element in the matrix. A peak is an element that is strictly greater than its left and right neighbors.
Return the position (row, col) of any such peak.

Constraints:
- You may assume there's at least one peak.
- Neighbors only mean left and right in the same row (not up and down).

Intuition:
We use binary search on the columns. For each mid-column, find the global max row.
Compare it with left and right neighbors in the same row.
Based on which neighbor is greater, move your search window accordingly.

Dry Run:
Input:
mat = {
    {10, 20, 15},
    {21, 30, 46},
    {7, 16, 32}
}
Step 1: midCol = 1, maxRow = 1 (30)
Left = 21, Right = 46 ‚Üí Go right

Step 2: midCol = 2, maxRow = 1 (46)
Left = 30, Right = out of bounds ‚Üí 46 > 30 ‚Üí Peak found
