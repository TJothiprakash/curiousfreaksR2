/*
Problem:
You are given `n` stalls and `k` cows. You need to place the cows in the stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is as large as possible.
Return the **largest minimum distance** possible.

Intuition:
- Sort the stalls to ensure they are in increasing order.
- Use binary search on the answer (i.e., the minimum distance between cows).
- For each distance `mid`, check if we can place all cows with at least `mid` distance apart using a greedy placement strategy.

Dry Run:
Stalls = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}, Cows = 3
Sorted: [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]
Search range: low = 1, high = 8
Try mid = 4 ‚Üí Can place only 2 cows ‚Üí too big ‚Üí high = 3
Try mid = 2 ‚Üí Can place all 3 cows at 1, 4, 8 ‚Üí valid ‚Üí result = 2, try more ‚Üí low = 3
Try mid = 3 ‚Üí Place at 1, 4, 8 ‚Üí valid ‚Üí result = 3, try more ‚Üí low = 4
End loop ‚Üí Return result = 3
