📅 Next Week Plan: Java Streams + Concurrency Rigorous Practice
✅ Goals by end of week:
Master Streams (functional, grouping, transformations)

Master Concurrency (thread safety, coordination, modern concurrency)

Build a real concurrent system:

🔧 Multipart File Uploader (10GB+ simulated) — with multiple threads chunking
& uploading in parallel to a mock cloud/storage

📍 Streams + Concurrency Rigorous Plan (7-Day Schedule)
Day	Topics	Focus
Day 1	🌀 Stream Deep Dive	flatMap, reduce, map chaining, custom collectors
Day 2	📊 Grouping, partitioning	Complex Collectors.groupingBy, partitioningBy, histogram
Day 3	🔁 Threading Basics	Thread, Runnable, synchronized, race conditions
Day 4	🚀 Executors & Atomicity	ExecutorService, Callable, Future, Atomic types
Day 5	🔄 Inter-thread communication	BlockingQueue, wait/notify, Latches, Semaphores
Day 6	🌉 CompletableFuture + Parallel Streams	Async pipelines, chained tasks, error handling
Day 7	💥 Build Day: Concurrent Multipart File Uploader	Split file, thread upload chunks, simulate cloud upload

🔧 Final Project: Multipart File Uploader
Features you’ll build:

Read a large file, split into chunks

Use ExecutorService to upload chunks in parallel

Use BlockingQueue to simulate bandwidth queue

Handle failures and retries

(Optional) Use CompletableFuture to chain steps

🧠 You’ll learn:

Real-world concurrency patterns

Resource-safe thread pool handling

Thread-safe counters/progress tracker

Graceful shutdown and error recovery
