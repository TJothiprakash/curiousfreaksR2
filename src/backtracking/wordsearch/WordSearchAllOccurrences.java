/*ðŸ”¹ Problem: Word Search â€“ All Non-Overlapping Occurrences

Given:

Board of characters

Word to search

Goal:

Find all positions where the word occurs.

Words cannot overlap â†’ same cell cannot be used in multiple occurrences.

Output:

List of paths, each path = list of coordinates for that occurrence.

ðŸ”¹ Intuition

Use backtracking DFS like before.

Maintain a global visited array.

Each DFS returns the path of coordinates for one word occurrence.

Mark all those cells in visited â†’ ensure non-overlapping.

Continue searching rest of board for other occurrences.

Pattern takeaway: path collection + global constraint + backtracking.

ðŸ”¹ Dry Run

Board:

A B C
A B C


Word = "ABC"

Start at (0,0): finds path â†’ mark (0,0),(0,1),(0,2) as used

Continue search: next occurrence starts at (1,0): finds path â†’ mark (1,0),(1,1),(1,2) as used

Paths collected: 2 occurrences.*/

/*Complexity

Time: O(M*N*4^L) Ã— occurrences (L = word length)

Space: O(L) recursion stack + O(M*N) visited array + O(occurrences*L) for paths

Slightly more complex than single occurrence because we maintain all paths + permanent visited.*/
