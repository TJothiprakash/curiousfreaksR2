 Your Learning GitHub Sandbox:
Profile A (Main Repo Owner)

This is where your main project lives.

Treat it as the "main organization" or core maintainer.

Profile B (Contributor)

Fork the repo from Profile A.

Clone it locally and make meaningful changes on a feature branch.

Push the branch and raise a Pull Request (PR) back to Profile Aâ€™s repo.

From Profile A:

Review the PR (write comments, request changes, etc.)

Use GitHubâ€™s merge, squash, or rebase and merge options to accept PRs.

Optionally, try resolving conflicts directly from GitHub UI or command line.

ðŸ’ª Learn These While Practicing:
Creating and switching branches (git checkout -b)

Pulling upstream changes (git remote add upstream ...)

Syncing forked repo with upstream (git fetch upstream, git rebase)

Squashing commits

Merge conflicts and resolution

Writing good PR descriptions and commit messages

Using .gitignore, .gitattributes, and GitHub Actions if you want to level up
